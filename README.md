# Making your own inclusive bot

## What, why, how
Ever saw a word in a repository that really made you feel bad? Why use it? Can't we use something else? We can!
How? At the point we use them, when we are making changes, wouldn't it be great to have a reminder of what anyone in our team found to be unhelfpul and unfriendly?

## Gathering the words
We need to talk to one another, ask the difficult questions of what feels unfriendly, unhelpful and not inclusive. If we can gather up those words in a place that is easily updatable, we are always thinking about how best to make everyone feel welcome. 


## Step 1
To begin, you'll need to be logged into your GitHub account, and you'll need to create a new repository. Make it public for the moment.

You can call it `inclusiveBot_yourname`

*stuck* Go here and clone
*speeding ahead* go to step 5 and get your key made and fed into your yaml

## Step 2
Create yaml files

*stuck* link to yaml
*speeding ahead* Start your list of words

## Step 3
Explain each bit of yaml files

## Step 4
Create readme 
*stuck* basics in here
*speeding ahead* go to step 7 and get index.js started

## Step 5
Generate key and place in yaml, explain how this works
Remember: importance of git ignore, don't commit env variables
*stuck* a key they can use
*speeding ahead* Get your messaging set, add an image, have fun in step 8

## Step 6
Get wordy - generate your list
*stuck* just put one or two words
*speeding ahead* test with test yaml step 9

## Step 7
index.js and writing the the functions that will look at the incoming pull requests
Remember: talk about node.js modules here
*stuck* clone the functions
*speeding ahead* test in the repo or on another repo you have PR access

## Step 8
The messaging, who it comes from and what it says
*stuck* we found a banana
*speeding ahead* how else would you like to customise? A Github bot user, that one gets posting rights

## Step 9
Set up test file and test
*stuck* copy from repo
*speeding ahead* gather your questions and if we don't get to them, drop me a line i'll give contact details at the end

## Step 10
Set up on your own repo and test
*stuck* double check your action and test yaml, try open PR on your own repo
*speeding ahead* here's the finished article to refer to, many ways to do things, make yours work for you
How would you make that list of words something work for your team? A google sheet? What works for your team workflow?
